				<!--<h4>Can someone who isn’t a member view the marketplace?</h4>-->

				<!--<p>No. Our website is designed so that it can only be viewed by Art Retail Network members with either an artist or gallery/industry membership. This is one of our major differences from other artist websites. Unlike others we are not customer facing and do not try and sell work through our website. Rather Art Retail Network is a website for artists to connect with galleries and access ActivCanvas. The Industry-facing Marketplace and ActivCanvas are digital tools to enhance your real world art industry engagement and success.</p>-->

				<h4>How does ActivCanvas Work?</h4>

				<p>ActivCanvas is an image recognition app that allows audiences to access hidden audiovisual content by scanning an activated artwork with their smartphone. Artists can select an artwork(s) and activate it with relevant documentary footage connected with that specific piece. Through the platform they can activate that artwork so that audiences can access the footage through the ActivCanvas app wherever that artwork may be in the real world, in a gallery, on a screen, or in print. You can change, update, and deactivate,  the content behind your work through your Art Retail Network Profile.</p>

				<h4>How do I deactivate my account?</h4>

				<p>To permanently delete your account please contact the team through support@artretailnetwork.com. Please include within your email. Your full name,email address with which your account is connected, and the type of your subscription package if you currently hold one. The team will answer your enquiry promptly and let you know of the successful deletion.</p>

				<h4>How do I stop the payments for my ActivCanvas Subscription?</h4>

				<p>To stop your subscription please contact the team through support@artretailnetwork.com. Please include within your email. Your full name,email address with which your account is connected, and the type of subscription package you currently hold. The team will answer your enquiry promptly and let you know of the successful subscription deactivation. We are working towards automating deactivation to make it self-service in future.</p>

				<h4>What Smartphones does ActivCanvas work with?</h4>

				<p>ActivCanvas currently works on Android 4.03 upwards and iOS 7 and upwards. If you have an issue downloading the app please contact support@artretailnetwork.com. Our team are constantly improving accessibility and functionality of the app across platforms.</p>

				<h4>How do I edit one of my artworks?</h4>

				<p>To edit an artwork you need to be open on your profile page of the platform. Once on your profile hold your cursor over the artwork you wish to edit and you will see a red button, with a pencil icon, appear in its top corner. When you click on this red button it will open a pop up where you can edit all the information fields for that specific artwork. Remember to save changes.</p>

				<!--<h4>What is ‘Connections’ in my sidebar?</h4>-->

				<!--<p>Connections is where you view the artists or galleries you can communicate directly with. You can make someone a connection request by hitting the ‘Connect’ button on the top right hand corner of their profile. Once confirmed by both parties this Connection will be visible within the ‘Connections’ tab of the sidebar.</p>-->

				<!--<h4>What are ‘Shortlists’ and how do I use them?</h4>-->

				<!--<p>Shortlists are where you can group together different artworks you have seen in the Marketplace. They are a tool to help with exhibtion planning, inspiring your artwork, or simply saving images to easily show friends or colleagues later. You can create a Shortlist within the Shortlist tab on the side of your profile. Once you have created a Shortlist you will be able to add artworks to this Shortlist whilst browsing the Marketplace. To add an artwork to a Shortlist simply click on the artwork and click on the ‘Shortlist’ button within the Pop up.</p>-->

				<!--<h4>What is the Marketplace?</h4>-->

				<!--<p>The Marketplace is a page devoted to listing artwork by member artists currently using the site. You can search the artwork on the marketplace through a variety of fields including; Style, Price, Type, Key Word, and Colour. When you upload artwork to your profile people will be able to see and search for it on the Marketplace.</p>-->

				<h4>What are the image requirements for uploading an artwork successfully?</h4>

				<p>Images need to be either a JPG or PNG file no larger than 10MB. Try and take a well lit, high resolution image that is cropped so that any framing, background, or supporting wall is cut out of the image and only the artwork itself is included.</p>

				<h4>What are Tags?</h4>

				<p>When you upload an artwork, aside from completing fields such as ‘Title’ and ‘Medium’ , you can tag your artwork with key terms related to it (eg. ‘Trees’, ‘Scotland’, ‘Shadows’). People are able to search the Marketplace using key terms. The tags that you use to describe your artwork will help these searches find appropriate artwork.</p>

				<h4>How do I delete artwork from my profile?</h4>

				<p>To delete a piece of art go to your profile and hover your cursor over the artwork you wish to delete. You will see a red button, with a pencil icon, appear in its top corner. When you click on this red button it will open a pop up where you can edit all the information fields for that specific artwork. Within this pop up you need to click on the Delete button</p>

				<!--<h4>How do I activate my artwork with ActivCanvas?</h4>

				<p></p>-->

				<h4>Can I upload videos from Youtube?</h4>
				<p>Unfortunately at the moment you cannot upload content straight from Youtube. You will need to download the video first then upload it onto the site. We are hoping to build a Youtube functionality into the platform soon.</p>
