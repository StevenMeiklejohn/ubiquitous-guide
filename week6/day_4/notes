Callbacks are functions passed in to other functions.
In js, they are known are 'first class objects' as they can be passed around.


A higher order function is a function which takes or returns a function.
A first class object is a function which can be treated like an object (string, array etc)
Functions can be passed as arguements.
===============================================

Async = Non-blocking language
Sync = Blocking languauge

Asynv basically means that is step 2 in a programme take a while to run, step 3 can be running in the meantime.
E.g. A coffee shop. A sync of blocking coffee shop, would take a customers order then make the order before taking another.
An Async shop would take an order then hand it off to a barista and take another order,

==================================================
In Ruby, when we want to (for example), loop through an array, we use a block. In js we use anonymous functions.
