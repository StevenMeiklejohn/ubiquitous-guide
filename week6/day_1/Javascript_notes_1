check version of node.
node -v

JS used camel_Case.


Javascript
+++++++++++


This is my bear.
var myBear = "Yogi";

Is not the same as
 myBear = "Yogi";

instead of def and end we use funtion and curly brackets.
Functions and such cannot begin with a number or special characters (excluding $ and _ which can be used.)
function hello(name){
Instead of saying puts, we say console.log;
console.log(name + " you are awesome! ");
}

to call the function. Use the same method as Ruby.

hello ("Steven");

in the console type: node app.js 

 We can also use variable such as;

hello (myBear);


Variable types.
================

 Javascript does not use 'objects', we have
Primitive Types:
- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
[- Symbol]
object

*see js_types.js

strings are wrapped in an object. This allows us to call methods on them.

e.g.
var myString = "a nice string we are creating";

console.log(myString.length());
console.log(myString.toUpperCase());

*see js_contol_flow

JS Arrays.
Create Array:

IN javascript "Hashes" are the equivelant of "objects"
========================================================



type node to enter java environment

âžœ  node_app node
> typeof([1,2,3])
'object'


JavaScript Scope
==========================

Ruby is 'block scoped', Ruby is 'function scoped'

*see scope.js
