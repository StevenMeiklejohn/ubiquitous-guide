The easiest way to create an object in js:

var myObject = {};

myObject.shape = 'circle';
myObject.radius - 10;

console.log( myObject);

However, this is time consuming to do for each instance.
so, in JS we do.....

var House = function( sqFeet, bathrooms, bedrooms ) {
  this.sqFeet = sqFeet;
  this.bathrooms = bathrooms;
  this.bedrooms = bedrooms;
}

Note the capitalized House.
this.sqFeet

There are lots of ways to create an object in js, constructor, factory, 

*See object_constructors examples.

Java does not have 'inheritance'.
But every object has a prototype, which is the object which every object gets created from.
Prototpinh

for example, if we tried to call a method on an object and the object had such a method, it will run that. If the object does not have that method, js will check the object prototype to see if it has the method for joininghings or peolr
