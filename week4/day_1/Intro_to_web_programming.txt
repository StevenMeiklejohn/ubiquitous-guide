Intro to web programming
========================
The internet is simply computers connected together.
web:
The web is a collection of web servers connected together.
HTML - Hyper Text Mark Up Language
HTTP - HYper Text Transfer Protocol
URL - Uniform resource locator


HTTP sends stuff through a browser over an HTTP protocol.
But first, a client (web browser) must request stuff.
The client makes a request(www.bbc.co.uk), then the web server makes a response (HTML, video, JSON)

=> http request, html response.

Ruby and connected databases are used to generate the html which will be sent to the client.

Alternative methods include
SMTP = simple transer for email.
FTP = File transfer proptocol.


=>
URL
=====

http:// = protocol
wwww.bbc.co.uk = domain_name
/sport/tennis= path
^ IN this example, 'sport' is a resource.
Models are also resources (match, team, etc)
