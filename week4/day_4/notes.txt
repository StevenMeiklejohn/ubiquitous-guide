Many to many notes.
===================

Build a library.

BOOKS           MEMBERS
id              id
title           name
author          address


        RENTALS
        id
        book_id (foreign key)
        member_id(foreign key)

- Get Library Codebase. week4/day_4/CClibrary_start_point.

Multiple controllers so main controller.rb references the others which are contained in 'controllers' folder.

- Create seed file which clears and reinstates data on the app.
  Run using: ruby db/seeds
  check suuccess by going ito psql and doimg;
  SELECT * from books;
  SELECT* from mambersl


===================

createdb cclibrary
sql -d cclibrary -f db/cclibrary.sql

Create rentals controller and add functions (index, new, create) Doing so may require new functions being added to the model page (.save, .all etc)
