# CC-PokeDex-StartingPoint
The starting point for a PokeDex app iOS app, which we'll build over the course of my CodeClan session.

# Getting started

This guide assumes you've cloned this repo into a folder called CC-PokeDex-StartingPoint-2.

## Xcode

Okay, first things first - the majority of all iOS development is done using an IDE called Xcode. To do anything with this project, you're going to need a working installation of Xcode 7.3 (or above). You can get Xcode from the Mac App Store. Alternatively, if the Mac App Store isn't working for you, you can try going to [this link](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) clicking on "Additional Tools" and signing in with your Apple ID.

Xcode contains both a text editor, as well as the majority of the tools required to build and ship iOS apps. Don't worry too much about working with Xcode, as that's something I'll cover in the session.

## "I installed Xcode... what next?"

Good start. Now we need to make sure you can run the sample project. Navigate to `CC-PokeDex-StartingPoint-2`, where you cloned the repo and open the file `CCPokemonApp.xcworkspace`. Once the project has opened, click the play button in the top-left corner. If an iOS simulator starts up, and then you see printed output in the console at the bottom of Xcode, we're good to go.

## "It went wrong. These instructions suck."

If the above doesn't work for you, then feel free to email me at `matthew( at )wetheplural( dot )com` and I'll do my best to troubleshoot remotely. Otherwise I'll do what I can during the session. :)
